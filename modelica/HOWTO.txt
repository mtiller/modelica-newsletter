== How to do migrations: ==

First do "./manage.py startmigration newsletter <some_name> --auto"

This will determine the changes and record them.

Then do "./manage.py syncdb" (not sure if this is necessary)

and then do "./manage.py migrate"

If blank/null is not allowed and no default is given, you'll have problems.
You may have to go into the migrations file (newsletter/migrations) and
change the db alter commands to include default values (at least for the
initial migration?).

If you run into a case where it cannot delete a column, use sqlitebrowser to
do it.
